âœ… Short Answer

    OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in PHP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects (instances of classes). It helps structure code around real-world entities using concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, making code reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.

ðŸ“– Long Answer

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP is a way of writing programs where the focus is on objects instead of just functions and logic.

    An object is an instance of a class (a blueprint).

    A class defines properties (variables) and methods (functions) that represent the data and behavior of something.

    OOP allows developers to model real-world entities (like Car, User, Invoice) inside the code.

    ðŸ”‘ Core Principles of OOP in PHP:

        Encapsulation â€“ Bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) together, controlling access using access modifiers (public, private, protected).

        Inheritance â€“ A class can inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting reusability.

        Polymorphism â€“ Objects can take many forms; the same method name can work differently in different classes.

        Abstraction â€“ Hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary features using abstract classes or interfaces.

    âœ¨ Benefits:

        Reusability â€“ Write once, reuse in multiple places.

        Maintainability â€“ Easier to update and debug.

        Scalability â€“ Ideal for large projects.

        Real-world modeling â€“ Code reflects real-world entities and relationships.
